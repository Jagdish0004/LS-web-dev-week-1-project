            <h2>An Overview</h2>
            <p>Badminton is a fast-paced racquet sport played by either two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles), who take positions on opposite halves of a rectangular court divided by a net. The objective is to hit a shuttlecock, a feathered or plastic projectile, over the net and into the opponent’s half of the court. A rally ends once the shuttlecock touches the ground, and points are scored based on where it lands. Players must prevent the shuttlecock from hitting the ground on their side while aiming to strategically place it in their opponent’s court. Matches are typically played to the best of three games, with each game won by the first player or team to reach 21 points, provided there is a two-point lead. Badminton requires agility, quick reflexes, and tactical thinking, making it an exhilarating and competitive sport enjoyed worldwide, from casual backyard games to professional tournaments.</p>
